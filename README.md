## Configure and use in Laravel

### Service Provider and Facade

Only if using Laravel Framework you should include the `PipedriveServiceProvider` to the providers array in `config/app.php` and register the Laravel Facade.

```php
'providers' => [
  ...
  Devio\Pipedrive\PipedriveServiceProvider::class,
  ...
],
'alias' => [
    ...
    'Pipedrive' => 'Devio\Pipedrive\PipedriveFacade::class'
    ...
]
```

### The service configuration

Laravel includes a configuration file for storing external services information at `config/services.php`. We have to set up our Pipedrive token at that file like this:

```php
'pipedrive' => [
    'token' => 'the pipedrive token'
]
```

Of course, as many other config parameters, you could store the token at your `.env` file or environment variable and fetch it using `dotenv`:

```php
'pipedrive' => [
    'token' => dotenv('PIPEDRIVE_TOKEN')
]
```

### Use it

The only particularity about using this package in Laravel is we can make use of the included Facade and do not have to worry about instantiation:

```php 
$organizations = Pipedrive::organizations()->all();
//
Pipedrive::persons()->add(['name' => 'Jon Doe']);
```
